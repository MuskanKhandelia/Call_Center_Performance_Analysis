# Call Center Performance Analysis - Power BI Project

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Call Center Performance Analysis Power BI project. This project is designed to provide insights into call center performance through the visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) and analysis of various parameters affecting performance.

## Overview

The Power BI project focuses on displaying major KPIs such as total calls, answered calls, abandoned calls, resolved issues, and more. It utilizes different chart types including pie charts, clustered and stacked column and bar charts to visualize the data effectively.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Pre-processing:**
  - Initial data cleaning and pre-processing were performed using Power Query to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

- **Calculated Columns and Measures:**
  - Calculated columns and measures were created using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to extract deeper insights from the data and properly display the information.

- **Agent and Topic Analysis:**
  - Analysis provided is based on different agents and topics to identify performance trends and areas for improvement.

- **Trend Analysis:**
  - Monthly and daily call trend analysis is presented to track call volume over time and identify patterns.

- **Filter Pane:**
  - A filter pane is incorporated into the dashboard, visible upon clicking the filter icon and can be closed by clicking the close icon. This allows users to filter data according to their requirements without occupying extra space on the dashboard.
